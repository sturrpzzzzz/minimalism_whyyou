        Annie takes a deep breathe in. The rain brings about such a refreshing,
        earthy scent to the atmosphere. She can hear kids running around,
        laughing and shouting. "I love the rain!", they said.<br />
        Annie loved the rain as a kid as well.<br />
        Maybe the rain isn't that bad after all.<br /><br />

        Ben is doing better in class than ever. There is something so satisfying
        about being able to solve difficult questions and praised by the
        teacher, and the dopamine pushes him to study even more diligently.
        Learning doesn't feel like a chore anymore.<br />
        Maybe getting picked for hard questions isn't that bad after all.<br /><br />

        Alice finally broke down and told her mum how she felt. More like
        yelled. Her mum was taken aback, as she never thought she had caused her
        daughter so much distress. They had a heart to heart conversation and
        learnt each other's perspectives. Their bond grew stronger than ever
        before.<br />
        Maybe getting yelled at by your mum isn't that bad after all.<br /><br />

        Maybe there is something good out of every situation after all.

        I used to wonder why other people were so privileged.<br /><br />

        No matter how much I tried, there is always someone prettier.<br />
        Smarter.<br />
        Richer.<br />

        Better.

        There was never a moment in which I was satisfied with myself. I would
        better myself, just to see someone better than me.<br />
        So why does it matter?<br /><br />

        It was so easy to just keep dragging myself down and feel miserable.
        That's why I was completely offended when someone told me I could
        just... choose to be happy with myself. What do you mean I can fix a
        problem I have had my whole life just by... changing my mind? What do
        you mean I can just choose not to be sad, as if I was causing my misery
        instead of the world?<br />

      <p class="story" id="story12">
        It wasn't easy to change the way I have been thinking my whole life, but
        I forced myself to see the good in everything no matter what, because I
        was sick of living under the rain everyday. What do I have to lose from
        thinking positively anyway?<br /><br />

        Now, I am happier and more grateful for my life than ever, and I feel
        better about myself than ever.<br /><br />

        And do you know what the best thing about all this is?

        We, as a society, have normalised and encouraged negativity to the point
        that we have rewired our brains to automatically find and focus on
        something to complain about.<br />

        It is infinitely easier to spiral into negativity than to do something
        about it. There is always something good coming out of any situation,
        something to be happy about in our lives no matter how big or small, but
        seeing it is a choice.<br /><br />

        And remember, you are always infinitely more beautiful and capable than you think you are.
      </p>
      <button class="option" id="option13" onclick="hideKnot13()">
        A choice?

      <p class="story" id="story14">
        It is scientifically proven that
        <a href="https://christianespinosa.com/blog/neural-pathway-highways-and-ruts-change-your-habits/#:~:text=Repeating%20the%20same%20actions%20or,make%20a%20strong%20neural%20pathway."
        >repeating a behaviour for at least 10000 times rewires your brain and develops new habits.</a><br>
        No matter how heavily perpetuated negativity is in your lives, if you keep choosing to plant
        the garden of your mind with positive thoughts, your mind will
        automatically come to positive conclusions.<br /><br />

        We see the world as we interpret it. Our interpretation comes from
        what we focus on. The key is to see the positive in everything first.<br /><br />

        Whether or not you experience happiness is within your control.<br /><br />

        So what will you choose?<br />
